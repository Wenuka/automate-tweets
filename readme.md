# Automate Tweets with Twitter API v2

This GitHub repository hosts a Python script that enables automated daily tweeting on X (formely Twitter). The script uses the Tweepy library to access the Twitter API v2. It allows users to schedule daily (or any desired frequency) tweets, which you compiled before.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Add your Twitter API credentials and quotes to the script.
3. Change the csv file to add your content
4. Set up a scheduler to run the script at your desired time each day.
